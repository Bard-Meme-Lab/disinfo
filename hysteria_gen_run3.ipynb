Covid19 is an AI induced virus, which is projected into your \"GEB\" (Genetic Energy Bridge). In about 80 years, scientits will work with the Genetic Energy Bridge to produce a synthetic and cybernetic human society. Covid19 is the first step towards an illuminati timeline setup. Most people will not survive, only those with a very fast metabolism will survive the coming Covid19 mass extinctions.\n",

            "Death is order, because life is chaos, so death needs less or no control, while life needs a lot of control, to satisfy the principle of order. Death is actually not possible, but leaving the body is the only chance to get free from the massive insanity that humans have inside of them and this massive insanity of humans comes from the body-soul matrix. An agreement by various alien research groups was the reason why humans were created artificially so humans were embedded in a simulated world as a by-product.\n",

            "Dr Thomas Cowan: ‘The shocking thing … is that using their own methods, the virologists found that solutions containing SARS-CoV-2 — even in high amounts — were NOT, I repeat NOT, infective to any of the three human tissue cultures they tested. In plain English, this means they proved, on their terms, that this “new coronavirus” has not been found to be infectious to human beings. It has been shown repeatedly, over and again, that studies designed to find the DNA of a new virus will not be able to match the viral genome to a human tissue culture they test.\n",
